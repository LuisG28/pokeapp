why Next.js?
    For this practice I use next js because it helps me to 
    create react js applications quickly including navigation paths

Commands to run this app 
    First run this command : npm i
    Wait for dependencies to be installed
    To initialize the app run the command : npm run dev
    open url displayed in console for example : http://localhost:3000
